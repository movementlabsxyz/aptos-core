Below is an example README.md tailored for the observability stack’s Docker Compose folder:

---

# Observability Stack

This directory contains the Docker Compose configuration and supporting files needed to launch a full observability stack locally. This stack includes:

- **Loki:** A log aggregation system.
- **Mimir:** A scalable metrics backend.
- **Tempo:** A distributed tracing backend.
- **Alloy:** An OpenTelemetry Collector distribution.
- **Grafana:** A visualization and dashboarding tool.

## Design Overview

The setup is designed to emulate a production observability pipeline in a local development environment. Each service is configured via a dedicated configuration file:

- **alloy-config.alloy:** Configures Alloy with logging, server, and storage settings.
- **loki-config.yaml:** Provides a minimal configuration for running Loki (log ingestion, storage, and indexing).
- **mimir-config.yaml:** Sets up Mimir for storing and serving metrics.
- **tempo.yaml:** Configures Tempo to receive and display distributed traces.

The `docker-compose.yml` file orchestrates these services, ensuring they run on separate containers with defined port mappings and volume bindings.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Make sure Docker is installed and running.
- **Docker Compose:** Ensure you have Docker Compose installed.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Navigate to this directory:**

   ```bash
   cd docker/compose/metering
   ```

2. **Verify the Configuration Files:**

   - **alloy-config.alloy:**  
     Configures Alloy to listen on port 12345 and store its data at `/var/lib/alloy/data`.

   - **loki-config.yaml:**  
     Sets Loki to listen on port 3100 with an in-memory KV store for ring management.

   - **mimir-config.yaml:**  
     Configures Mimir to listen on port 9001 and use a filesystem storage at `/data/mimir`.

   - **tempo.yaml:**  
     Sets up Tempo to listen for OTLP gRPC traces on port 4317 and expose a web UI on port 3200.

3. **Launch the Stack:**

   Start all services in detached mode:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command pulls the latest images (if not already available) and starts the containers.

4. **Access Grafana:**

   - Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
   - Log in with the default credentials:
     - **Username:** `admin`
     - **Password:** `admin`

5. **Configure Grafana Data Sources:**

   In the Grafana UI, add the following data sources:
   
   - **Loki:**  
     URL: `http://loki:3100`
     
   - **Mimir:**  
     URL: `http://mimir:9001`
     
   - **Tempo:**  
     URL: `http://tempo:4317`
   
   These internal hostnames (loki, mimir, tempo) are resolved by Docker Compose’s network.

## Stopping the Stack

To stop and remove all containers, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Logs:**  
  If any container is not starting properly, inspect its logs with:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs <service-name>
  ```
  Replace `<service-name>` with `loki`, `mimir`, `tempo`, `alloy`, or `grafana`.

- **Port Conflicts:**  
  Ensure that the ports defined (3100, 9001, 4317, 3200, and 3000) are free on your machine.

- **Container Health:**  
  Verify service readiness by checking health endpoints (e.g., Loki’s `/ready`).

---

This setup provides a local environment for testing and developing observability features. It’s ideal for debugging, performance testing, and verifying the telemetry output of your services before deploying to production.

Happy monitoring!
